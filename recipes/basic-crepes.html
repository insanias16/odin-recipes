            <li>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. 
                    Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. 
                    Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. 
                    Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. 
                    Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</p>
